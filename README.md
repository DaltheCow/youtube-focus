# youtube-focus
An extension to help keep you from wasting time on youtube

I block sites that distract me while I work but I like to listen to music on youtube to help keep me focused.
That means leaving youtube unblocked, so I needed a way to have youtube unblocked for certain videos and blocked for everything else.

##Main Features (in progress)
Allow only certain videos and playlists
Remove the related videos sidebar
Remove navbar

##Potential Future Features
Optional: allow certain channels
